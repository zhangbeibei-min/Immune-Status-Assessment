# Immune-Status-Assessment
Our approach involved the development of a three-platform model to standardize CBC data. We then employed an EM-GMM model to cluster participants based on their immune status. Utilizing RF, LightGBM, and XGboost algorithms, we assigned weights to each CBC index and constructed a comprehensive immune status evaluation model.Compared to previous research, our model is more scientific and feasible in terms of operation, providing a robust framework for quantitative assessment.
